In this post we’ll discover one of the alternatives.</p>\n<h2>Stack</h2>\n<p>In this example we’ll use open-source Mapbox GL JS library for rendering the map. It allows us to render raster or vector tiles from any provider that has is compatible with mapbox format.</p>\n<h2>Tiles</h2>\n<p>Tiles contain the map data like roads, oceans, parks etc. They can be either raster or vector. Raster tiles are just raster images that get directly displayed while vector tiles contain the data for each map feature then gets rendered. Vector tiles allow for more flexibility for example: custom styles for everything on the map, smooth scrolling, smaller network footprint, ability to insert new features between layers.</p>\n<h2>Tiles providers</h2>\n<p>There are some tiles providers on the market:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mapbox</li>\n<li>OpenMapTiles (with OpenStreetMap data)</li>\n<li>TomTom</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this example I’ll use TomTom vector tiles.</p>\n<h2>Setting up map</h2>\n<p>Follow mapboxgl tutorial on how to create map</p>\n<p>add urls from tomtom sdk</p>\n<h2>Customizing with maputnik</h2>\n<p>add sum styles get funky heyooo</p>\n<h2>Add some features under text</h2>\n<p>This thing that you usully can’t do with raster maps (sometimes they provide haks such as separate tile for labels only)</p>\n<h2>React HOOKS? ??</h2>\n<p>react hooks babyyy</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Life after Google — map for your website","date":"April 22, 2019","description":"How to add and customize vector maps in javascript."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/life-after-google/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/reasonml-by-example/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ReasonML by example"}},"next":null}}
