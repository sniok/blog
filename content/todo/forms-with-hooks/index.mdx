> This is not a big shiny library that everyone should use. This is my thoughts on state management.

## Why

When working with some libraries and reading about others I noticed the same pattern. And they all felt wrong.

After thinking about it I came up with my wish list:

- you shouldn't pass "UI" component(input) to "logic" component(field), it should be the other way
- we have hooks for reusable logic!
- you shouldn't create `values` object for whole form. this hurts composability
- 'form' is just a bunch of values, it shouldn't be a thing at all!
- form management shouldn't handle all aspects of form creation â€” it's library not a framework
